# DogVsCat Detector

A Dog and Cat Detector app built using a Computational Neural Network

## About The Project

This is a simple Dog and Cat Detector app built using **Flutter SDK** which works on both, **Android** and **iOS**. The **Computational Neural Network** (CNN) was built using Google's **Teachable Machine** and then exported to my flutter application using **tensorflow** and the tflite package.
